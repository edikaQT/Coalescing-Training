Surprisingly Robust Violations of Stochastic Dominance Despite Coalescing Training: A Quasi-Adversarial Collaboration


 
**************

This set of files provides step-by-step instructions to replicate all of the figures and tables in the paper.

Before running the code, make sure to set the global variables at the top of the file to your local directory locations. 

You can access the experimental materials used in the study at https://github.com/neil-stewart/stoc_dom_2. 

Additionally, a video of the experimental training can be found at https://github.com/neil-stewart/stoc_dom_2/blob/main/screenshots/toggle.mp4.

To assist with the replication process, Appendix B displays the Visual Stimuli Presentation Sequence in All Experimental Conditions.


**************

The "2023 data" folder contains the raw data, while the "2023 cleaned" folder contains the cleaned data. 

The "2023 codes" folder contains the code used to clean the data and replicate all analyses in the paper. Specifically, "200423 raw_data_cleaning.do" cleans the raw data, while "200423 analysis.do" reproduces all regressions, figures, and tables presented in the paper (an R version of the code can be found in "200423 analysis.R")

The "2023 output" folder contains the figures produced by the "200423 analysis.do" code.
